# AllInOneIME

[中文](README.md) | English

A macOS input method. Day to day it's a regular pinyin input method that runs locally, built on Rime + rime-ice
(雾凇拼音). Start a sentence with `@` for a command and press ⏎ when done to run it: `@improve` has a large language
model on Amazon Bedrock give three idiomatic English versions and a few rewrites, `@question` asks a question,
`@claude` opens Claude Code in Terminal, and `@open` finds files and apps. You can also hold right ⌥ and talk.

![Two steps: @improve plus pinyin, then ⏎ for English versions and Chinese rewrites](docs/en/demo.png)

![@improve plus English: English polish (with Jargon); with the output set to Chinese: Chinese polish](docs/en/english.png)

For more detail (every command and setting, installation troubleshooting, privacy), see the [Wiki](https://github.com/weijianz-opc/AllInOneIME/wiki).

## How to use

Without `@`, it works like any other pinyin input method: picking a word inserts it, ⏎ is Return, in English mode letters are typed directly, and nothing goes online.

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| Type pinyin, Space / digits | Pick words, as in any pinyin input method |
| `@` (at the start of a sentence) | Opens the command list: at most 5, the most used lately first; type letters for the others (names starting with them first, then names containing them). ⏎, Tab, Space or a digit chooses |
| ⏎ | Runs the command. Works even if the pinyin isn't picked yet: it's picked first, as with Space |
| Space, ⏎ / digits | Once the results are up: insert the highlighted / numbered one; 0 is the original |
| ⌘C | Copies the highlighted result (for `@open`, the path); the candidate panel stays open |
| ⌃V | In a command (e.g. after `@improve `, or in a sentence-mode draft): appends the clipboard text after what you've typed instead of pasting it into the app. Multiple lines become one, up to 2000 characters at a time. Works in any app; without a command, the key goes to the app as usual |
| ⌘V | Like ⌃V, but some apps handle ⌘V themselves (terminals such as Ghostty, iTerm2 and Terminal, and Notes) and paste into the app as usual; use ⌃V there |
| ⏎ (nothing written after the command yet) | Uses the clipboard text: it's shown in the command first, then ⏎ runs it. E.g. after copying a paragraph: `@i` ⏎ ⏎ ⏎. Works in any app |
| Esc, ⌫ | Back to the sentence to keep editing; typing just continues it |
| Tap Shift | Switch between Chinese and English |
| Hold right ⌥ | Talk, release to stop. Chinese in Chinese mode, English in English mode. In a command, the text goes after it; otherwise it's inserted directly |
| ⇧Space | Turn sentence mode on or off (see below) |

## @ commands (beta)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `@improve` | Polish / translate: 1–3 are three versions in the output language, 4 onward are rewrites, 0 is the original |
| `@question` | Ask a question; the answer appears in the candidates, ⏎ or Space inserts it, ⌘C copies it |
| `@claude` | Opens Claude Code in Terminal with what you wrote as the first message; then keep talking to it in Terminal and have it do the work. Nothing is inserted |
| `@open` | Lists matching files, folders and apps as you type (Spotlight). Text starting with `~/` or `/` is a path: Tab completes it and goes into folders; ⏎ opens, ⌘C copies the path |

Example: `@q` ⏎, type `什么是量子计算` ("what is quantum computing"), ⏎. Once the command is chosen, you can also hold right ⌥
and talk. `@open` switches to English letters for the moment and goes back to Chinese when you're done.

![Typing @ opens the command list; @question plus a question, then ⏎ for the answer](docs/en/commands.png)

![@open finds apps as you type; starting with /, it's a path: the folder is listed, Tab completes](docs/en/open.png)

When `@` isn't followed by a command, as in `@张三` (a name) or `@john`, the `@` is inserted as usual, so @-mentioning
people in chat apps still works.
`@question` and `@improve` send to your own Bedrock only when you press the action key; `@open` searches only on this
Mac; `@claude` uses the Claude Code installed on your Mac (the `claude` command) and its own account, and it asks you
first, as usual, before changing files or running commands. Without Claude Code installed, `@claude` isn't offered.

### Your own commands

In the settings, under "Custom @ Commands", click "Add Command…": give it a name and choose what it does (an AI
instruction, a program, or a program in Terminal), or start from an example. Your commands come after the built-in
ones; names are English letters only and can't be a built-in command's; they work from the next sentence.
They're kept in `customCommands` in the config file (`~/.config/allinoneime/config.json`), which you can also edit:

```json
"customCommands": [
  { "name": "python", "type": "run", "argv": ["python3", "-c", "{input}"], "summary": "Run Python" },
  { "name": "calc", "type": "run", "argv": ["bc", "-l"], "stdin": "{input}\n" },
  { "name": "sh", "type": "terminal", "argv": ["zsh", "-c", "{input}"] },
  { "name": "reply", "type": "prompt", "prompt": "Write a short, polite reply to the user's message." }
]
```

| `type` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | Goes to the AI with `prompt` as its instruction; the answer appears in the candidates, to insert or copy (⌘C) |
| `run` | Runs `argv` in the background; what it prints appears in the candidates (several lines are inserted as printed). On an error, its last line is shown |
| `terminal` | Runs `argv` in a new Terminal window; nothing is inserted |

- `{input}` becomes what you wrote after the command, and it always stays within the one argument it's in: no shell is involved. For a shell, say so, like `sh` above (`zsh -c`).
- `stdin`: what goes to the program's standard input, with `{input}` replaced too.
- `run` and `terminal` type English letters by default (like `@open`; Chinese comes back after), and full-width punctuation becomes ASCII: `print（“牛逼”）` → `print("牛逼")`. Set `"ascii": false` to keep text as typed.
- Programs run in your home folder with your login shell's PATH (so Homebrew, pyenv and nvm installs are found). `run` stops a program after 10 seconds (`timeoutSeconds`) or when it prints too much; Esc stops it at any time.
- `summary` is the description in the command list (optional).
- When the program in `argv` isn't found (say, no `python3`), the command isn't offered and `@python …` is inserted as text; once it's installed, the command appears in the next text field.

`run` and `terminal` run code on your Mac: only add commands you wrote and trust. They, too, run only when you press the action key, and never during secure input.

### Action key

⏎ by default; change it under "Action key" in the settings (`actionKey` in the config): ⏎, Tap ⌥ (either side: press
and let go right away; holding right ⌥ is still for talking), ⌥Space, or Space (press Space once more after the words
are picked; twice in English mode).
Whatever the action key, @ commands also run on ⏎. If ⌥Space is already a shortcut for Alfred, Raycast or the like,
they get it first.

### Sentence mode

The original behavior: when it's on, text goes into a draft even without `@`, and the action key polishes / translates
the finished sentence, as if every sentence started with `@improve`.
To insert it as typed, press ⇧⏎ (⏎ when the action key isn't ⏎). Turn it on in the settings, or toggle it with ⇧Space
(in Chinese mode). Off by default.

## Input and output

Two choices in the settings:

- **Default input**: Chinese (pinyin) or English; the mode a new text field starts in. Tap Shift to switch at any time.
- **Output (lines 1–3)**: whether lines 1–3 of `@improve` are English (default) or Chinese. Text in the other language is translated; text in the same language is polished:

| | Output: English | Output: Chinese |
|---|---|---|
| Typing Chinese | Translate to English | Polish the Chinese |
| Typing English | Polish the English | Translate to Chinese |

In sentence mode, English goes into a draft too; if you don't want that, turn off "Sentence mode: English too" in the settings.

## Rewrite styles

After lines 1–3 come the rewrites, **in the language you typed**: Chinese rewrites for Chinese, English rewrites for English. Pick any of them in the settings:

- Polish: same tone, more natural
- Concise
- Formal: for managers and clients
- Casual
- Tactful
- Jargon: big-tech jargon in Chinese (对齐 align, 抓手 lever, 颗粒度 granularity…), Amazon-speak in English (bandwidth, circle back…). Bad news is played down, e.g. "this is a blocker bug" → "Oh! Looks like your team has the bandwidth to fix this minor issue!"

Rewrites that only change punctuation or repeat another line aren't shown.

### Jargon list (your own terms)

Jargon has no built-in term list. You can prepare your own (for example, the phrases your team uses), and the model
prefers its terms. In the candidates, the Jargon line notes what the terms it used mean, e.g.
"Jargon · PRFAQ＝新功能提案文档" (new-feature proposal doc).

The list is a text file with one term per line, optionally followed by its meaning, separated by "：" (full-width colon),
"=" or a Tab (you can copy two columns from a spreadsheet and paste them). Lines starting with `#` are comments:

```
PRFAQ：新功能提案文档（先写新闻稿和 FAQ）
COE：事故复盘文档
two-way door：可以随时撤回的决定
抓手：着力点
```

(In English: PRFAQ = new-feature proposal doc, press release and FAQ written first; COE = incident review doc;
two-way door = a decision you can undo at any time; 抓手 = point of leverage.)

Under "Rewrite Styles → Jargon list" in the settings, click "New" to create an empty list at `~/.config/allinoneime/jargon.txt` and open it;
if you already have a list file, click "Choose File…" to use it where it is (`jargonFile` in the config). Changes apply right away.
Only the first 150 terms are read. With "Jargon" checked, the list is sent to Bedrock along with each request.

## Voice input

<img src="docs/en/voice.png" width="340" alt="Hold right ⌥ to talk">

Hold right ⌥ and talk; when you let go, the text is inserted. If you type a command first (e.g. `@improve `, `@question `) and then talk, the text goes after the command and ⏎ runs it; you can also press ⏎ without letting go of right ⌥ to run it as soon as you finish. Speech is recognized on the Mac by macOS's built-in speech recognition (SpeechAnalyzer), and no audio is uploaded; it needs macOS 26 or later.

The first time:

- macOS asks whether AllInOneIME may use the microphone. You can also click "Allow Microphone" in the settings beforehand.
- If this Mac doesn't have the speech model for that language yet, it's downloaded once, automatically. You can also download it in the settings.

Recording starts only after you've held the key for about 0.2 s, so a quick tap on right ⌥ doesn't turn on the microphone (with the action key set to "Tap ⌥", a tap runs the action). If you press another key while holding it (an ⌥ shortcut, ⌥←), it counts as a shortcut and nothing is recorded either. Pressing any other key while recording cancels the recording.

## Installation (from source)

Running it needs macOS 14 or later, voice input macOS 26 or later. Building needs Xcode 26 or later, since voice input uses the macOS 26 SDK.
So far it has only been tested on macOS 27 + Xcode 27 on Apple Silicon.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/weijianz-opc/AllInOneIME.git
cd AllInOneIME
make install
```

`make install` downloads librime and the rime-ice dictionaries and verifies them, builds, installs into `~/Library/Input Methods`,
and puts "AllInOneIME Settings" in `~/Applications` ("AllInOneIME 设置" on a Chinese system).

`make install` enables AllInOneIME and adds it to your input sources; after that, switch to it with Ctrl+Space
(the 🌐 key switches only if "Press 🌐 key to" is set to "Change Input Source" in System Settings → Keyboard).
If it ends by telling you to add it by hand, this Mac doesn't let programs enable it, so add it once yourself:
System Settings → Keyboard → Text Input → Input Sources → Edit… → + (bottom left) → Chinese, Simplified → AllInOneIME.

If Ctrl+Space doesn't get you to AllInOneIME, or it switches back to U.S. after a while, run `make install` again:
it adds AllInOneIME back to your input sources. The `listed:` line in `make status` shows whether it's in the list.

If you had AIPinyin (AI 拼音) installed, just run `make install`: it removes the old AIPinyin.app and "AI 拼音设置" (its settings launcher),
and the entry in your input sources gets the new name, with no need to add it again. Settings, the jargon list and learned words move to the new folders
(`~/.config/allinoneime` and others) on first launch, and each old folder is left as a link to the new one.

Before upgrading, read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.en.md): it has each version's changes and upgrade notes. The `version:` line of `make status` shows which version is installed.

To uninstall: `make uninstall`.

## Setting up the AI

Translations and rewrites use your own AI provider, and the costs go to your account: Amazon Bedrock in your AWS account by default, or the Claude API, Gemini or an OpenAI-compatible service (see "Other AI providers" below).

### Amazon Bedrock

1. Enable Bedrock in the AWS console and make sure you can use the chosen model. The default is Claude Haiku 4.5; the first time you use an Anthropic model, you fill in a use-case form once.
2. Create an access key with the `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` permission and put it in a profile in `~/.aws/credentials`.
   Only such static keys are supported for now, not SSO or assume-role.
3. Open "AllInOneIME Settings": you can find it in Spotlight or in Applications, or open it from the input method's icon in the menu bar → Settings….
   Pick the profile, region and model, and click "Test Connection". "Language" at the top of the settings window can be 中文 or English; by default ("System") it follows the system
   (Chinese if Chinese comes before English in the system's preferred languages, English otherwise). The settings window, the hints in the candidate panel and the input menu all follow it.

<img src="docs/en/settings.png" width="420" alt="The settings window">

### Other AI providers: Claude API, Gemini, OpenAI-compatible services

You don't need AWS: pick one under "AI Provider" in the settings, paste an API key, click "Save", then "Test Connection".

| Provider | Default model | API key |
|---|---|---|
| Claude API | `claude-haiku-5-5` (fastest, cheapest; Sonnet 5.5 and Opus 5.5 are more careful but slower and pricier) | [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com) |
| Gemini API | `gemini-3.8-flash` | Google AI Studio |
| OpenAI-compatible | OpenAI's `gpt-6-luna` (or `gpt-5.4-mini`); "Common Services…" has DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, Zhipu GLM, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter and Ollama on this Mac: picking one fills in its base URL, then enter its model | The service's key; set the Base URL to its address, e.g. `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`, or `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama on this Mac |

- API keys are kept in the system keychain, never in the config file. Without one there, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) and `OPENAI_API_KEY` from your shell are used.
- "Thinking" is low by default: the input method waits on every sentence, and less thinking is faster. Choose "Not set" for models that don't take it.
- With Claude Opus 5.5 or Sonnet 5.5 chosen, requests carry the Claude API's refusal fallback (`fallbacks: "default"`): when a safety classifier declines, the server retries on another model.
- In the config file: `provider` (`"bedrock"`, `"anthropic"`, `"gemini"`, `"openai"`), and `model`, `baseURL`, `effort` and `temperature` under `anthropic`, `gemini` and `openai` (unset ones use the defaults).

All settings are stored in `~/.config/allinoneime/config.json`; after a change, the next translation uses the new settings, with no restart. The newer keys:

| Key | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `defaultInput` | Default input: `"zh"` Chinese, `"en"` English | `"zh"` |
| `outputLanguage` | Language of lines 1–3: `"en"` / `"zh"` | `"en"` |
| `englishAI` | In sentence mode, English goes into a draft too | `true` |
| `voiceInput` | Hold right ⌥ to talk | `true` |
| `actionKey` | Action key: `"enter"` (⏎), `"optionTap"` (Tap ⌥), `"optionSpace"` (⌥Space), `"space"` (Space) | `"enter"` |
| `uiLanguage` | Interface language (settings window, candidate panel hints, menu): `"zh"`, `"en"` | `null` (follow the system) |
| `rewriteStyles` | Rewrite styles, e.g. `["润色", "简洁", "黑话"]` (Polish, Concise, Jargon) | `["润色", "简洁", "正式"]` (Polish, Concise, Formal) |
| `jargonFile` | Your own jargon list file | `null` (i.e. `~/.config/allinoneime/jargon.txt`) |

## Privacy

- Pinyin typing is entirely local. Only when you press the action key on `@improve` or `@question` (or on a sentence in sentence mode) is that sentence sent to the AI provider you chose (your own Bedrock, or the service whose key you added). With "Jargon" checked and a jargon list set, the list is sent along with it.
- Voice is recorded only while you hold right ⌥ and is recognized on the Mac; the recognized text is sent only in the commands above, when you press the action key.
- The input method reads the clipboard text, once, only when you press ⌃V or ⌘V in a command (or a sentence-mode draft) or press the action key with nothing written after a command; content that password managers mark as concealed isn't read. The text is shown in the draft first and, again, is sent only when you press the action key. Recent macOS versions ask whether AllInOneIME may read the clipboard: allow it. To stop being asked every time, set AllInOneIME's paste permission to always allow in System Settings → Privacy & Security.
- In password fields (secure input) it doesn't compose text and can't record. Whenever the system is in secure input (password fields, Terminal's Secure Keyboard Entry, etc.), nothing is sent to the AI.
- Logs don't record what you type. For every third-party input method, macOS warns "The developer can access anything you type with this input source"; it's a generic system warning.

## Development

```sh
make test         # unit tests, plus tests that run the real Rime engine
make selftest     # drives the input method through a simulated text field: real Bedrock calls, plus on-device recognition tested with synthesized speech
make realtest     # types into a real app's text field (needs the screen unlocked; takes over the foreground for about 1 minute)
make screenshots  # regenerates the screenshots in docs/
make cli && .build/release/allinoneime-cli --styles 简洁,黑话 "我今天有点不舒服"   # try translation and rewrites in the terminal (styles Concise, Jargon; "I'm not feeling well today")
make icon         # regenerates the app icon and the menu bar icon from Resources/AppIcon.png
```

Code layout:

- `Sources/AllInOneIMECore`: Bedrock client, SigV4, prompts, the two-level input state machine (including English drafts and the voice gesture); no AppKit dependency
- `Sources/AllInOneIMERime`: librime wrapper
- `Sources/AllInOneIME`: the InputMethodKit input method, candidate panel, settings window, speech recognition
- `Sources/AllInOneIMESettings`: the "AllInOneIME Settings" launcher

The bundle ID is still `com.aipinyin.inputmethod.AIPinyin`: macOS uses it to remember the added input source and the microphone permission, so changing it would mean adding the input method and granting the permission again.
