/// document) instead of being inserted; in `sentenceMode` (the original flow) every sentence does. In
/// English mode, typed letters can start a draft too (`englishAI`), and holding the right Option key
/// dictates into the draft. The action key (`ActionKey`: Return by default, an Option tap, ⌥Space, or Space on a finished draft) starts
/// level two: pinyin still being typed is converted first, then the sentence goes to the model, which
/// streams three versions in the output language and rewrites in the configured styles, or to the
/// @ command at its start (`Command`).
